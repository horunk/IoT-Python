To give you an idea of what we're looking for in a README, here are some particularly good README's which were submitted for homework 5. In general, characteristics of a good README included:

Brief or no discussion of concepts which were stated in lecture (eg, how an AVL tree does its rotations)
Succinct discussion of important design issues that were faced, the solution that was decided upon, as well as the rationale behind the decision.
For the Shakespeare/Bacon or extra credit analyses, it was important to state:
the problem/question they were answering,
any relevant data that they collected,
an answer to the stated question, which is justified by the collected data.
Note that length of the README, or graphics, did not determine the quality of a README -- the most important characteristic was that all conclusions were justified.
